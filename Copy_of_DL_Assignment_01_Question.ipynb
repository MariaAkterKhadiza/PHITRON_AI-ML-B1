        "A single-layer perceptron is the simplest type of neural network: it has an input layer and an output layer (no hidden layers). While it can handle some simple problems, it has significant limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "A perceptron can only classify data if a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) can separate the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Works: Classifying points that form two clusters separated by a line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fails: XOR problem — inputs (0,0),(1,1) → 0 and (0,1),(1,0) → 1 cannot be separated by a single line\n",
        "\n",
        "It cannot capture complex patterns or interactions between features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world data is often non-linear. A single-layer perceptron cannot draw curved or complex decision boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) adds one or more hidden layers between the input and output. This simple change solves many limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hidden layers with non-linear activation functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh) allow the network to approximate any complex function.\n",
        "Each hidden layer transforms the input space into a new feature space, enabling the network to capture complex feature interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple layers allow curved or irregular decision boundaries, making the network suitable for real-world tasks like image or speech recognition.\n",
        "An MLP with at least one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function, given enough neurons."
